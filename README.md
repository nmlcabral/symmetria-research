# symmetria-research

Exploratory work for Project Symmetria — notebooks, reports, figures, and references.
This repo is **not** for production code. Anything promoted to reusable code moves to `symmetria-core`.

## Structure
- `notebooks/` — exploratory notebooks (experiments, EDA, drafts)
- `reports/` — polished write-ups summarizing findings
- `figures/` — exported plots/images used in reports
- `references/` — papers, links, citations, notes
- `templates/` — notebook/report templates

## Ground Rules
- Keep notebooks focused; one idea per file.
- Save large outputs/plots to `figures/`, not embedded as huge cells.
- No large datasets; use small samples or references to `symmetria-data`.
- Document key learnings in `reports/` if a notebook yields a clear result.
